        Some notes:
            * gap: is required only on iOS (when using UIWebView) and is needed for JS->native communication
            * https://ssl.gstatic.com is required only on Android and is needed for TalkBack to function properly
            * Disables use of inline scripts in order to mitigate risk of XSS vulnerabilities. To change this:
                * Enable inline JS: add 'unsafe-inline' to default-src

            The game is simple: try to guess the number the computer is guessing. Pick a number between 
            1 - 10. You can only guess one number at a time. If you get it right, you win! If not, you'll 
            feel a vibration and you'll lose.
